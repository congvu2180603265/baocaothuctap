# Build Serverless Playwright System on AWS

#### Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how to build an automated end-to-end testing system using **Playwright**, containerized with **Docker**, and deployed on **AWS Fargate**. The system uses a serverless architecture orchestrated by **AWS Lambda**, **SQS**, and **EventBridge**.

You will deploy the core components step-by-step, from configuring the secure network (VPC), setting up storage and queues, building the Docker image, to exposing the API and Frontend for users.
